# PID Control - Static Webpage with Google Colab Integration

This prototype demonstrates a **static lecture webpage** linked to an **interactive Google Colab notebook** for hands-on PID control learning.

## 🎯 Concept

- **Static HTML**: Clean, fast-loading lecture content from `pid_manual.md`
- **Interactive Lab**: All code experiments and visualizations in Google Colab
- **Seamless Integration**: Direct links from theory to practice

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` - Main static webpage with PID theory
- `styles.css` - Modern, responsive styling
- `PID_Interactive_Lab.ipynb` - Complete interactive notebook
- `README.md` - This file
